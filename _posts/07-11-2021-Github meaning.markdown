GitHub is a worldwide organization that gives facilitating to programming advancement adaptation control utilizing Git. It is an auxiliary of Microsoft.
The first time I am searching the GitHub meaning in Google, then searching another platform like GitHub that’s Bit-bucket, git-lab. Git-Lab is the favorite option to replace GitHub. 
it’s the closest to GitHub in terms of use and feel. better of all, Git-Lab is open-source software. you’ll download and install it on your server. 
Bit-bucket may be a version control repository hosting service from Atlantis. it’s tightly integrated with other Atlantis project management tools like Jira, Hip-chat, and Confluence. 
This makes it a preferred choice for giant enterprises. A lot of open-source projects have already been using Git-Lab. GNOME and GIMP are several examples. 
now I m searching deeply for GitHub also as check it’s history, advantage, disadvantage, uses, working, etc. 9 to 10 video I will be able to check on the YouTube. 
And understanding what’s GitHub?. I m create the account on GitHub and repository.
